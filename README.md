Australiaâ€™s economic recovery from COVID-19 pandemic is underway. The bitter aftermath includes the increase in unemployment and increase in government debt. The problem this project seeks to address is what economic trends we can see currently see and what we can expect in Australia during a post pandemic world. Shifts in stock market can affect the value of individual savings and pensions. In response to stock falls, central banks in many countries including Australia slashed interest rates making borrowing cheaper and encouraging to spend more to boost the economy. The travel industry has been severely damaged while the demand for oil dried up worldwide. Many people have lost their jobs and the income is cut due to the COVID-19 pandemic. IMF predicts that the economy will shrink globally by 3% by the end of year 2020 where we can expect a worst decline since last great depression of year 1930.  Looking at these impacts in a larger scale, our analysis can help anyone who lives in Australia to understand the current and emerging trends within the industries to prepare themselves for upcoming challenges as well as opportunities in a world suffering and trying to recover from COVID-19 pandemic.
